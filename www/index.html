			<h4>1.	16 Rotunda Terrace </h4>
			<h5>Gustavus and his family are listed in the 1861 census as living here. The family consisted of Gustavus, Honoria, Adolphus, Lorenz, Matthias, Nina and Katherine. 
				It is likely that the house was also a shop where Gustavus dealt in harps.  
				Gustavus brought up all his children to be musicians. His daughter Kate also taught at the Ladies’ College. His son Matthias was a renowned concert pianist and also apparently a heartthrob who went to a fancy dress party naked. Gustavus’ other son, Adolphus (Adolph) was also a talented musician. Adolph was well known in Cheltenham for being a concert pianist and also for organising concerts in a range of venues across the town. He was also the organist at All Saints’ Church in Cheltenham.

			<h4>2.	The Rotunda </h4>

				first performance was given of two juvenile works by the 16 year old Gustav Holst. They were listed in the programme as Scherzo and Intermezzo. The pieces were never published and the original autograph manuscripts are now in the Holst Birthplace Museum archives.

He wrote a letter in 1853 from 5 Queen’s Circus accepting the position as Professor of Music at Cheltenham Ladies College. This letter is now in the archives at the Cheltenham Ladies College archives.  He describes in the letter how he is able to supply ‘first rate’ instruments (pianofortes etc) for purchase ‘which can be seen at my residence here where I have several.’

			<h4>5.	Cheltenham Town Hall </h4>
			<h5>When Cheltenham’s main concert venue, the Assembly Rooms were demolished, Cheltenham Town Hall was built to provide a new venue for balls and concerts. Built in 1902-03, the Town Hall played an important part in the career and musical legacy of Gustav Holst. In 1927 it hosted the Holst Festival where Holst conducted The Planets. Holst later said the occasion was the most overwhelming event of his life. As well as the Holst Festival the Town Hall also hosted the British premiere of what Holst considered his best work, Egdon Heath in 1928. 

			Today Cheltenham Town Hall remains a venue where Holst’s music is often performed, for example in recent years there have been performances there of The Planets, Savitri and Beni Mora.

However in the 1891 census, Adolph and his family are listed as living here with Adolph’s second wife Mary Thorley Stone. Adolph is listed as teacher of piano and an organist. Gustav is listed as 16 and a ‘scholar’. His brother Emil, 14 is also listed as a ‘scholar’. At this point Gustav had two half-brothers, Matthias and Thorley, 4 and 1. At that time there were two live in servants: Sarah A Snow, aged 27, a cook born in Cheltenham, and Matilda Dickenson, aged 16, the children’s nurse, born in Notgrove, Gloucestershire.

The Lediard family were originally from Cirencester. Clara had been Adolph’s piano pupil. According to the Cheltenham Annuaire, a town directory, the newly married couple moved to this house. They lived here until 1874, just a few months before Gustav was born.

		 <center><h3>Gustav Holst, composer of The Planets, was born in this Regency house in 1874. The Museum was set up in 1975 to celebrate Cheltenham’s most famous son and also to offer a glimpse into what life was like for an ordinary 19th century family living in the town. Step back in time as you wander through its historic rooms, including Holst’s Victorian bedroom, nursery, kitchen and scullery. Imagine Cheltenham’s Regency past in the only Regency room open to the public in the town, complete with hand blocked wallpaper, fine furnishings and 19th century art collection. See and listen to the piano Holst used to compose The Planets in a recreation of his music room. Delve deeper into his life in the Holst Discovery Space, through archives and film. Drop into the Learning Space for one of our regular family activities.
		 
             We are a small, independent museum governed by the Holst Birthplace Trust, registered charity number: 1078599.</h3></center>
